// Two things this file exists to get right, both learned from the logs.
//
// .mjs, not .js: Vercel compiles a handler in a package without "type": "module" to CommonJS, and
// require() of this ESM package fails at the first invocation with ERR_REQUIRE_ESM.
//
// Named methods, not a default export: the Node runtime reads a default export as the old
// (req, res) => void signature and discards whatever it returns, so a handler that answers with a
// Response hangs until the 300-second timeout. Exporting POST and GET selects the fetch-style API.
// The package it imports is .mjs for the same reason: node-file-trace copies the imported file
// into the bundle but not the package.json beside it, so a .js file there loses its
// "type": "module" and is read as CommonJS - and a CommonJS file provides no named exports to
// import. The extension travels with the file; the package.json does not.
